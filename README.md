# MatCont with demonstrations for branching of homoclinic orbits near BT points

This repository hosts MatCont version 7p2 with demonstrations for branching of homoclinic orbits near Bogdanov-Takens points in ordinary differential equations.
It accompanies the preprint [Interplay between normal forms and center manifold reduction for homoclinic predictors near Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12570)
by M.M. Bosschaert. and Yu.A. Kuznetsov.

The notebooks in the directory `BTnotebooks` are combined in a Jupyter Book hosted at https://mmbosschaert.github.io/MatCont7p2NewInitBTHom-/intro.html.
