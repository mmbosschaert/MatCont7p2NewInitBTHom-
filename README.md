# MatCont with demonstrations for branching of homoclinic orbits near BT points

This repository hosts MatCont version 7p2 with demonstrations for branching of homoclinic orbits near Bogdanov-Takens points in ordinary differential equations.
It accompanies the paper "Interplay between normal forms and center manifold reduction for homoclinic predictors near Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation"
by M.M. Bosschaert. and Yu.A. Kuznetsov.
